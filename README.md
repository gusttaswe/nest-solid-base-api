# Nest.js API Boilerplate

This is a simple template for building a Nest.js API that follows SOLID principles and uses a package-by-feature approach.

## Features
- Built with Nest.js, a modern, powerful, and modular Node.js framework
- Adheres to SOLID design principles, which promote clean, maintainable, and extensible code
- Follows a package-by-feature structure, which allows for better organization and reduces coupling between modules
- Includes basic configuration for common features exception handling and validation
- Uses TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enables better tooling, safer code, and faster development
- Utilizes neverthrow which provides a simple and expressive way to handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors, while keeping your code clean and concise. 
- Comes with pre-configured scripts for building, testing, and running the application

## Getting Started
To use this boilerplate, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from the official websites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gusttaswe/nest-solid-base-api.git
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ cd nest-solid-base-api
$ npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/docs. You should see the Swagger UI, which provides a graphical interface for testing the API.
